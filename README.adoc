= Toporiq

Ethereum Smart Contract for storing signatures of off-chain entities in blockchain.

Like "_keep md5 of this file forever_". Which could be used as a distributed db of signatures, to verify
 downloads, or as a proof of something, or used from other contacts for validation/agreements and so on.

== Simple Sign contact

Made for self educational purpose, and not finished yet. At this moment there're only once super simple
 contract: `SimpleSign`.

It allows to:

 * create a _document_ in blockchain
 * add unlimited amount of _signatures_ to this document
 * signature consists of:
 ** _type_  - a name for signature. ASCII bytes, up to 16 characters long
 ** _value_ - signature value, a byte array
 * only document author can add signatures to a document

Contract is deployed at address: 0x0000 < NOT YET >

Notice that `type` and `value` could be anything, not restricted to any particular hash name and value.
  Which allows to store ordinary key-value pairs here. May be a "_filename=<filename bytes>_", or anything.
